# python-selenium-mock-up
a mock up of how our automation solution would look like in python (condensed)

python 2.7.4

to use go to terminal: 

$ mkdir <a place to put the code> 
$ cd <that directory you just made>
$ git clone git https://github.com/neuralhalation/python-selenium-mock-up

Open up test_basic.py and replace the setup path to your local instance of chromedriver.exe

Also edit the username and password to use the correct login information

Timing is still an issue in the application at the time of writing, so the solution suffers from not being able to get reliable load
times out of the application under test.
